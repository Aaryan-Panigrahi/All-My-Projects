Hello!
 
I have made 2 deifferent chat-application for this task.
So in the src folder here, are 2 different packages - 

1. one-way-chat
2. my_chat

The later (2. my_chat) is my final model, where I have used threading in python to run the subscriber and publisher simultaneously in each node. 
There are 2 executable pythoon scripts - node1.py, and node2.py representing 2 users chatting with each-other.

The former (1. one-way-chat) was my initial attempt, which is also complete. It has a total of 3 nodes.
The first two nodes - usr1-publisher.py and usr2-publisher.py are meant for the users to type the text they want to send. And the third node - usr-sub-common.py, is meant to be used as a display, whre both the users can see their conversation.

Thank you :)
